### **FAQ's**



**Can you add country name not on** [**Valid Country Codes**](https://github.com/jesmannstl/zap2xml_dispatcharr_plugin/blob/main/Valid%20Country%20Codes.md) **page?**
No.  The original zap2xml only supported US and Canada but I was able to expand it for most supported countries in North and South America plus the Caribbean.  This method did not work for Europe or Australia.  The data provider itself does not support Asia, Africa or Antarctica.



**Where can I find a lineupId for this area?**
I created a lineup lookup for supported countries at [https://zap2xml.jesmann.com](https://zap2xml.jesmann.com) just select the country name and add the Zip/Postal Code and search.
